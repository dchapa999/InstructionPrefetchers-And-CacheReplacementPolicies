Week of 1/18/21
Team: 
Worked on our first installment of our URS thesis.

Week of 1/25/21
Alex: 
Finished reducing the size of several of my instruction prefetchers to be around 32 KB:
    Bar√ßa:         112 KB to 33 KB
    PIPS:         128 KB to 33 KB
    MANA:         123 KB to 20 KB
    TAP:         124 KB to 29 KB
Simulated the reduced prefetchers to observe which ones had the highest speedups.
David:
Modified the ChampSim simulator to allow replacement policies to run on the L1I cache. 
This week and next week I plan to modify the replacement policies, so they are able to run on the L1I cache.

Team:
Worked on 1st bi-weekly presentation and setup team github.

Week of 2/1/21
Alex:
This week I got the new version of champsim up and running. I ported all of my prefetchers to the new version except for EIP which is
still giving me errors I need to resolve. Also, I modified our python scripts to do batch jobs for simulations and results on the new
ChampSim. 

David:
Some of the replacement policies are hanging when modified to work on the L1I cache, so this week I hope to fix this along with adding support to ChampSim to export data to an excel sheet.

Week of 2/8/21
Alex: 
This week I worked with David to finish running simulations of all prefetchers with different cache replacement policies.  

David:
I plan to run all simulations for the replacement policies individually, and I will begin running joint simulations with Alex.

Team: We compiled our results of our simulations.
