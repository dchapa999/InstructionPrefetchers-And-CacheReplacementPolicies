Week of 1/25/21
Alex: 
Finished reducing the size of several of my instruction prefetchers to be around 32 KB:
    Barça:         112 KB to 33 KB
    PIPS:         128 KB to 33 KB
    MANA:         123 KB to 20 KB
    TAP:         124 KB to 29 KB
Simulated the reduced prefetchers to observe which ones had the highest speedups.
David:
Modified the ChampSim simulator to allow replacement policies to run on the L1I cache. 
This week and next week I plan to modify the replacement policies, so they are able to run on the L1I cache.

Team:
Worked on 1st bi-weekly presentation and setup team github.

Week of 2/1/21
Alex:
While David is finishing porting those policies, I will work on reducing the D_JOLT prefetcher and figuring out the errors that come up with it.
Will also figure out how development branch champsim works and how to output results to text files

David:
Some of the replacement policies are hanging when modified to work on the L1I cache, so this week I hope to fix this along with adding support to ChampSim to export data to an excel sheet.
Next week I hope to begin creating combination policies with Alex.
